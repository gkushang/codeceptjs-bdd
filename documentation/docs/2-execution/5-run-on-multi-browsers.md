## ðŸŒ€ Run Parallel on Multiple Browsers

Codecpetjs-BDD can run your tests in Multiple Browsers, including multiple versions of same brwoser or different browsers on different OS on Sauce Labs. Multiple Browsers executions give your test suites a broader test-execution-coverage. 

**Can I run my all scenarios on Multiple Browsers but all in Parallel?** Yes. You can run all Scenarios in Parallel. If you have 100 scenarios, and if you want to cover three different browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, Safari, Chrome, then Codeceptjs-BDD will trigger 300 concurrent threads that all run in Parallel on all three defined browsers.

## Interactive CLI

This framework provides an Interactive CLI to setup the framework in just two steps. 

The CLI,
1. Creates a Codeceptjs BDD Framework for your App
2. Automatically updates your `package.json` with all required dependencies.
3. Installs all dependencies as part of setup process
4. Adds Master Configuration
5. Configures Sauce Labs (optional)
6. Runs existing Sample BDD Feature Files to test your setup

This Framework comes with the Sample BDD Feature files with examples. Please follow through the [Examples](https://github.com/gkushang/codeceptjs-bdd/tree/develop/packages/codeceptjs-cucumber/acceptance/features) to create your own Feature Files & Scenarios.

### Quick Setup

Below steps assumes you have already installed all the required dependencies from `Getting Started > Installation`

```bash
   cd codeceptjs-bdd/packages/codeceptjs-cucumber
    yarn
    npm run cli
```

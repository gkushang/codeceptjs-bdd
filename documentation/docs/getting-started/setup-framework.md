## Interactive CLI

This framework provides an Interactive CLI to setup the framework in just two steps. 

The CLI,
1. Creates a Codeceptjs BDD Framework for your App
2. Automatically updates your `package.json` with all required dependencies.
3. Installs all dependencies as part of setup process
4. Configures Sauce Labs (optional)
5. Runs existing Sample BDD Feature Files to test your entire setup

This Framework comes with the Sample BDD Feature files with examples.

### Setup Framework

Below steps assumes you have already installed all the required dependencies.

```bash
   cd codeceptjs-bdd/packages/codeceptjs-cucumber
    yarn

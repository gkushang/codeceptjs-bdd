### ** Prerequsite

1. In order to run on Sauce Labs, you should have an account with Sauce Labs. 

2. During Codeceptjs-BDD setup through CLI, you should have provided your Sauce Username and Sauce Access Key in order to start running your tests on Sauce Labs. 
3. You must export **SAUCE\_USERNAME** and **SAUCE\_KEY** environmental variables as shown below,

**Recommendation:** Export these enviornment variable through your ZSH or BASH profile.

**Can I Customize my Dashboard Title?**
Yes, you can do that too by by providing `SAUCE_BUILD` environment variable. This is sometimes very helpful to view how many and what tests ran for which release build.

Below command will create unique dashboard on sauce with title **release-1.0-{random-unique-number}**

```bash
    SAUCE_BUILD=release-1.0 yarn acceptance --profile sauce:chrome
```

## ‚ûï Supported Sauce Labs Browsers/OS Combinations

The supported browsers/OS is listed [here](https://github.com/gkushang/codeceptjs-bdd/blob/master/packages/codeceptjs-saucelabs/lib/browsers.conf.js). 

**Can I run on my own Customized browser/os?** 
Yes, you can override any existing configruation or provide new Browser configuration through your `codecept.conf.js` file. 

Follow the below steps,
1. Go to your codecept.conf.js
2. Go to last line of the config and look for `codeceptjs_saucelabs(SAUCE_USERNAME, SAUCE_KEY)`
3. Pass your customized Browser/OS combination JSON as a **third** argument in above function. 

Below call will add `opera` browser to your Sauce configuration at runtime.

```bash
codeceptjs_saucelabs(SAUCE_USERNAME, SAUCE_KEY, {opera: {
        browser: 'opera',
        capabilities: {
            'sauce:options': {
                seleniumVersion: '3.11.0'
            }
        }
    }
})
```

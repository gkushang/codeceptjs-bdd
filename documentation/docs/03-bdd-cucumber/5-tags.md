Tags are a great way to organise your features and scenarios. Cucumber features and scenarios can contain Tags marked with `@`. Tags can be used to run Subset of Scenarios.

```bash
   @checkout
    Feature: Checkout Cart

        @checkout_as_guest
        Scenario: Fred check out the item as a guest user
            Given hello

        Scenario: More other checkouts
            Given hello
```

A feature or scenario can have as many tags as you like. Separate them with spaces:

```bash
   @checkout @checkout_guest @checkout_registered
    Feature: Checkout Cart
```

Tags can be placed above the following Gherkin elements:

- Feature
- Scenario
- Scenario Outline
- Examples

#### Development Process

Another creative way to use tags is to keep track of where in the development process a certain feature is:

```bash

@qa_ready
Feature: Index projects

```
